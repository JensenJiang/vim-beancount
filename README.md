# vim-beancount

This is the beancount filetype for Vim.  Includes highlighting and some basic
functions.

## Installation

I suggest [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) or
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), but you can also just
copy all of the files into the appropriate places inside your '.vim' directory.
